MNIST Dataset Classification with SGD and Random Forest

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):

Stochastic Gradient Descent is a foundational optimization algorithm for training neural networks. When applied to the MNIST dataset, SGD involves creating a simple feedforward neural network with a softmax output layer. This network learns to classify handwritten digits by adjusting its parameters based on the gradients of the loss function. Training involves iterating through the dataset in batches, making it efficient for large datasets. The final model can achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

Random Forest:

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method widely used for classification tasks, including the MNIST dataset. In the context of MNIST, a Random Forest classifier is constructed by training multiple decision trees. Each tree is trained on a subset of the dataset, and predictions are made based on a majority vote. Random Forests are robust, handle high-dimensional data well, and are less prone to overfitting. They can achieve good accuracy on MNIST digit classification tasks without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

In summary, while SGD is a standard optimization approach for neural networks, Random Forest provides a different paradigm based on decision trees, showcasing the diversity of methods available for tackling the MNIST dataset. The choice between these approaches may depend on factors such as model complexity, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
